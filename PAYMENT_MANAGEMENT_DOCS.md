# Enhanced Order System with Stripe Payment Management

## Overview

The order system has been enhanced to capture and store comprehensive Stripe payment data for advanced operations like refunds and cancellations. This system **does NOT rely on webhooks** - all payment processing happens during the primary order creation flow for reliability and immediate processing.

## Key Features

### 1. Primary Payment Processing Flow

- **No Webhook Dependency**: All payment data is captured during order creation
- **Immediate Processing**: Payment intent data is retrieved and stored instantly
- **Reliable Data Capture**: Direct API calls ensure complete payment information
- **Fallback Handling**: Graceful handling of API failures with basic payment info

### 2. Comprehensive Payment Data Storage

- **Payment Intent Details**: ID, status, amount, currency, client secret
- **Charge Information**: Charge ID (essential for refunds), receipt URL, receipt number
- **Payment Method Details**: Card brand, last 4 digits, expiration, country, funding type
- **Transaction Information**: Stripe fees, net amount, timestamps
- **Refund Tracking**: Full refund history with amounts, reasons, and status

### 3. Advanced Payment Operations

- **Partial Refunds**: Refund specific amounts with reason tracking
- **Full Refunds**: Complete order refunds with automatic status updates
- **Order Cancellation**: Cancel orders with automatic refunds when applicable
- **Payment Details**: Retrieve comprehensive payment information for any order

## Payment Processing Architecture

### Primary Flow (No Webhooks Required)

```
1. Frontend creates payment intent with Stripe
2. User completes payment
3. Frontend sends order data + payment intent ID to backend
4. Backend retrieves complete payment data from Stripe API
5. Backend stores comprehensive payment information
6. Order is created with full payment details
7. Confirmation email sent
8. Inventory updated
```

### Optional Webhook Flow (Future Enhancement)

```
1. Stripe sends webhook events (optional)
2. Backend processes supplementary payment events
3. Additional payment status updates (if needed)
4. Webhook processing does NOT create orders
```

## Enhanced Order Model

```javascript
paymentIntent: {
  // Payment Intent details
  id: String,
  clientSecret: String,
  amount: Number,
  currency: String,
  status: String,

  // Charge information (needed for refunds)
  chargeId: String,
  paymentMethodId: String,

  // Customer information
  customerId: String,

  // Receipt and transaction details
  receiptUrl: String,
  receiptNumber: String,

  // Payment method details (safe, non-sensitive info)
  paymentMethodDetails: {
    type: String,
    cardBrand: String,
    cardLast4: String,
    cardExpMonth: Number,
    cardExpYear: Number,
    cardCountry: String,
    cardFunding: String,
  },

  // Transaction fees and net amount
  applicationFeeAmount: Number,
  stripeFee: Number,
  netAmount: Number,

  // Timestamps
  createdAt: Date,
  paidAt: Date,

  // Refund information
  refunds: [{
    refundId: String,
    amount: Number,
    reason: String,
    status: String,
    createdAt: Date,
    receiptNumber: String,
  }],

  // Processing metadata
  legacyData: {
    processedViaAddOrder: Boolean,  // Indicates primary flow processing
    originalAmount: Number,
    originalCurrency: String,
    metadata: Object,
  },
}
```

## API Endpoints

      "refunds": []
    },
    "refundable": true,
    "refundedAmount": 0
  }
}
```

## Order Creation Flow

### Frontend Integration

When creating an order with payment, you can pass the payment intent data in two ways:

**Option 1: Pass Payment Intent ID**

```javascript
const orderData = {
  // ... existing order data
  paymentIntentId: 'pi_1234567890', // From Stripe payment intent
  paymentMethod: 'Card',
  // ... other order fields
};
```

**Option 2: Pass Complete Payment Info (Current Implementation)**

```javascript
const orderData = {
  // ... existing order data
  paymentInfo: paymentIntent, // Complete payment intent object from Stripe
  paymentMethod: 'Card',
  isPaid: true,
  paidAt: new Date(),
  // ... other order fields
};
```

**Submit order - all payment processing happens here**

```javascript
const response = await fetch('/api/order/saveOrder', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify(orderData),
});
```

**Note**: The backend will automatically extract the payment intent ID from either `paymentIntentId` or `paymentInfo.id` and retrieve complete payment data from Stripe for secure storage.

### Backend Processing (Primary Flow)

The enhanced `addOrder` method will:

1. **Immediate Processing**: Retrieve complete payment intent data from Stripe
2. **Charge Extraction**: Extract charge information (needed for refunds)
3. **Comprehensive Storage**: Store all payment details in structured format
4. **Payment Method Support**: Handle Card, COD, and Free orders
5. **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback for API failures
6. **No Webhook Dependency**: Complete processing without waiting for webhooks

### Supported Payment Methods

- **Card Payments**: Full Stripe integration with payment intent processing
- **Cash on Delivery (COD)**: Order tracking without payment processing
- **Free Orders**: 100% discount orders with special handling
- **Future**: Easy extension for additional payment methods

## Webhook Integration (Optional)

### Current Status

- **Webhook Handler**: Available but not required for core functionality
- **Optional Processing**: Webhooks can be used for supplementary operations
- **No Order Creation**: Webhooks do NOT create orders (primary flow handles this)
- **Future Ready**: Easy to enable additional webhook processing when needed

### Future Webhook Enhancements

When ready to use webhooks, they can be used for:

- Payment status updates
- Dispute notifications
- Refund confirmations
- Additional payment events
- Real-time payment monitoring

## Security Considerations

### Payment Data Storage

- **No Sensitive Data**: Card numbers, CVV, and other sensitive payment details are NOT stored
- **Safe Payment Info**: Only store safe payment method details (brand, last 4 digits, expiration)
- **Stripe References**: Store Stripe IDs for accessing full payment data when needed
- **Primary Flow Security**: Direct API calls ensure data integrity

### Refund Authorization

- **Validation**: Ensure orders exist and have valid payment data before processing refunds
- **Amount Limits**: Prevent refunds exceeding the original payment amount
- **Status Checks**: Verify order status before allowing cancellations
- **Audit Trail**: Log all refund operations for security and compliance

## Error Handling

### Primary Flow Error Handling

1. **Stripe API Failures**: Graceful fallback with basic payment info
2. **Network Issues**: Retry logic and fallback mechanisms
3. **Invalid Payment Intents**: Validation and error responses
4. **Partial Data**: Store available payment data even if some fields are missing

### Common Scenarios

1. **Order Not Found**: Return 404 with clear error message
2. **Invalid Payment Data**: Return 400 if order lacks required payment information
3. **Refund Limits**: Return 400 if refund amount exceeds available amount
4. **Stripe Errors**: Handle Stripe API errors gracefully with fallbacks

### Fallback Mechanisms

- **Partial Data**: Store available payment data even if some fields are missing
- **Legacy Orders**: Maintain compatibility with existing orders
- **Manual Processing**: Flag orders for manual review when automatic processing fails
- **Immediate Processing**: No dependency on external webhook delivery

## Testing

### Test Scenarios

1. **Primary Flow Testing**: Create orders with payment intents, verify data storage
2. **Refund Processing**: Test partial and full refunds
3. **Order Cancellation**: Test cancellation with and without refunds
4. **Payment Details**: Verify comprehensive payment information retrieval
5. **Edge Cases**: Test free orders, COD orders, failed payments, invalid data
6. **API Failure Handling**: Test Stripe API failures and fallback behavior

### Test Data

Use Stripe test payment intents and charges for development:

- Payment Intent: `pi_1234567890`
- Charge: `ch_1234567890`
- Customer: `cus_1234567890`

## Migration
